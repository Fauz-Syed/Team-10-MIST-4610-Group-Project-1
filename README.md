# Problem Description
After meeting with the client, our team has recognized inefficiencies and potential errors in the club operations due to the fact that the soccer organization that our client is in charge of does not have a centralized system where all its data can be stored. To address these issues we have been tasked with creating and operating a database system that connects the different datasets such as clubs, teams, players, staff, tournaments, etc., and will be completely tailored to the wants and needs of the client. In addition, during this project we will create a data model which visualizes the relationships of the entities, we will occupy the datasets with synthetic data, and we will generate queries that provide practical insights into the operations of the organization. Overall the goal of the database is to streamline the club operations, maintain effective and efficient data/datasets, and enhance the experience of the entirety of the organization.
